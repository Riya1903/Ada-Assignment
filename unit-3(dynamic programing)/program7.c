//Analyze the time and space complexity of your implementation and compare it with the time and space complexity of a greedy algorithm.

The time and space complexity of the dynamic programming algorithm for the coin change problem depends on the number of coins and the target amount.
Let n be the number of coins and m be the target amount.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the dynamic programming algorithm is O(nm). 
This is because we fill in a table of size (n+1) x (m+1) using nested loops.
The outer loop iterates n times, and the inner loop iterates m times.
Therefore, the total number of operations is n*m.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the dynamic programming algorithm is also O(nm).
We use a table of size (n+1) x (m+1) to store the minimum number of coins required for each subproblem. 
Therefore, the space required is proportional to the size of the table.

On the other hand, the time and space complexity of a greedy algorithm for the coin change problem 
depends on the denominations of the coins. Let d be the number of different denominations of coins.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the greedy algorithm is O(d). This is because we sort the coins in descending order of denomination,
and then we iterate through the sorted coins until we reach the target amount. Therefore, 
the number of operations is proportional to the number of coins used.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the greedy algorithm is O(1). 
We only need a constant amount of space to keep track of the current amount and the number of coins used.

In terms of time complexity, the dynamic programming algorithm is generally slower than the greedy algorithm for small inputs,
but it can be much faster for larger inputs. In terms of space complexity, 
the dynamic programming algorithm requires more space than the greedy algorithm,
but the amount of space required is still manageable for most practical applications.
